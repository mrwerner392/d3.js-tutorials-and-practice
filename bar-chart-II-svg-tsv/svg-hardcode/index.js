// SVG

// Whereas HTML is largely limited to rectangular shapes,
// SVG supports powerful drawing primitives like
// BÃ©zier curves, gradients, clipping and masks.

// With SVG, typically geometries (i.e. width of a rect, see html) are
// included as attributes, where aesthetics (i.e. fill color, see css)
// are included as styles

// Text must be placed within "text" elements, which do not support
// margin or padding. x attribute is offset by three pixels from end
// of each bar, and dy attribute is used to center text vertically
